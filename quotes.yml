    from now on all generations will call me blessed; for the Mighty One has done
    great things for me, and holy is his name. His mercy is for those who fear him
    from generation to generation. He has shown strength with his arm; he has scattered
    the proud in the thoughts of their hearts. He has brought down the powerful from
    their thrones, and lifted up the lowly; he has filled the hungry with good things,
    and sent the rich away empty. He has helped his servant Israel, in remembrance
    of his mercy, according to the promise he made to our ancestors, to Abraham and
    to his descendants for ever.’

  t: I bow before the authority of special men because it is imposed upon me by my
    own reason. I am conscious of my inability to grasp, in all its details and positive
    developments, any very large portion of human knowledge. The greatest intelligence
    would not be equal to a comprehension of the whole. Thence results, for science
    as well as for industry, the necessity of the division and association of labor.
    I receive and I give--such is human life. Each directs and is directed in his
    turn. Therefore, there is no fixed and constant authority, but a continual exchange
    of mutual, temporary, and, above all, voluntary authority and subordination. Of
    escape there are but three methods--two chimerical and a third real. The first
    two are the dram-shop and the church, debauchery of the body or debauchery of
    the mind; the third is social revolution. In a word, we reject all legislation,
    all authority, and all  privileged, licensed, official, and legal influence, even
    though arising from universal suffrage, convinced that it can turn only to the
    advantage of a dominant minority of exploiters against the interest of the immense
    majority in subjection to them.  This is the sense in which we are really Anarchists.

    The American left today as I know it--and believe me, I am very familiar with

    becoming the real right in the United States. We don't have an appreciable American
    left any more in the United States. What I saw of the SDS in the '60s was very
    abhorrent to me: Marxism, Leninism, almost the KGB mentality--a police politics
    that I found completely totalitarian in nature. And in Europe, I would say that
    today the real support for State power and totalitarianism comes from the Communist
    parties and the Socialist parties and, where they are sizable, the Trotskyist

  t: To speak of ‘limits to growth’ under a capitalistic market economy is as meaningless
    as to speak of limits of warfare under a warrior society. The moral pieties, that
    are voiced today by many well-meaning environmentalists, are as naive as the moral
    pieties of multinationals are manipulative. Capitalism can no more be ‘persuaded’
    to limit growth than a human being can be ‘persuaded’ to stop breathing. Attempts
    to ‘green’ capitalism, to make it ‘ecological’, are doomed by the very nature
    of the system as a system of endless growth.

  t: Almost anyone, I suppose, can call himself or herself an anarchist, if he or
    she believed that the society could be managed without the state. And by the state--I
    don't mean the absence of any institutions, the absence of any form of social
    organisation--the state really refers to a professional apparatus of people who
    are set aside to manage society, to preëmpt the control of society from the people.
    So that would include the military, judges, politicians, representatives who are
    paid for the express purpose of legislating, and then an executive body that is
    also set aside from society. So anarchists generally believe that, whether as
    groups or individuals, people should directly run society.

  t: I had entered the communist children's movement, an organisation called the Young

    I'd gone through the entire '30s as a--Stalinist--initially, and then increasingly
    as someone who was more and more sympathetic to Trotskyism. And by 1939, after
    having seen Hitler rise to power, the Austrian workers revolt of 1934 (an almost
    completely forgotten episode in labour history), the Spanish revolution by which
    I mean the so-called Spanish civil war--I finally became utterly disillusioned
    with Stalinism, and drifted increasingly toward Trotskyism. And by 1945, I, finally,
    also became disillusioned with Trotskyism; and I would say, now, increasingly
    with Marxism and Leninism.

  t: Libertarian in the United States has a meaning which is almost the opposite of
    what it has in the rest of the world, traditionally. Here, libertarian means  ultra-right-wing
    capitalist. In the European tradition, libertarian means socialist.  So, anarchism
    was sometimes called libertarian socialism, a large wing of anarchism,  so we
    have to be a little careful about terminology. In America, libertarian means  'extreme
    advocate of total tyranny.' It means power ought to be given into the hands  of
    private, unaccountable tyrannies--even worse than state tyrannies because [in
    them] the public has some kind of role.

    years, as their power in the economy has radically increased, and with it their
    political power. That has set in motion a vicious cycle that has concentrated
    immense wealth, and with it, political power in a tiny sector of the population,
    a fraction of 1%, while the rest increasingly become what is sometimes called
    ’a precariat’--seeking to survive in a precarious existence. They also carry out

    or blanket, someone gave him these things. We were too uncivilized to set much
    value on personal belongings. We wanted to have things only in order to give them
    away. We had no money, and therefore a man's worth couldn't be measured by it.
    We had no written law, no attorneys or politicians, therefore we couldn't cheat.
    We really were in a bad way before the white men came, and I don't know how we

  t: The economic anarchy of capitalist society as it exists today is, in my opinion,
    the real source of evils. I am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these
    grave evils, namely through the establishment of a socialist economy, accompanied
    by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals. In such

  t: Private capital tends to become concentrated in few hands, partly because of
    competition among the capitalists, and partly because technological development
    and the increasing division of labor encourage the formation of larger units of
    production at the expense of smaller ones. The result of these developments is
    an oligarchy of private capital the enormous power of which cannot be effectively
    checked even by a democratically organized political society. This is true since
    the members of legislative bodies are selected by political parties, largely financed
    or otherwise influenced by private capitalists who, for all practical purposes,
    separate the electorate from the legislature. The consequence is that the representatives
    of the people do not in fact sufficiently protect the interests of the underprivileged
    sections of the population. Moreover, under existing conditions, private capitalists
    inevitably control, directly or indirectly, the main sources of information (press,
    radio, education). It is thus extremely difficult, and indeed in most cases quite
    impossible, for the individual citizen to come to objective conclusions and to
    make intelligent use of his political rights.

  c: Excerpt from speech 'The Other America'
  d: 14 March 1968
  t: Now I wanted to say something about the fact that we have lived over these last
    two or three summers with agony and we have seen our cities going up in flames.
    And I would be the first to say that I am still committed to militant, powerful,
    massive, non violence as the most potent weapon in grappling with the problem
    from a direct action point of view. I'm absolutely convinced that a riot merely
    intensifies the fears of the white community while relieving the guilt. And I
    feel that we must always work with an effective, powerful weapon and method that
    brings about tangible results. But it is not enough for me to stand before you
    tonight and condemn riots. It would be morally irresponsible for me to do that
    without, at the same time, condemning the contingent, intolerable conditions that
    exist in our society. These conditions are the things that cause individuals to
    feel that they have no other alternative than to engage in violent rebellions
    to get attention. And I must say tonight that a riot is the language of the unheard.
    And what is it America has failed to hear? It has failed to hear that the plight
    of the negro poor has worsened over the last twelve or fifteen years. It has failed
    to hear that the promises of freedom and justice have not been met. And it has
    failed to hear that large segments of white society are more concerned about tranquility
    and the status quo than about justice and humanity.

    For, turn where he will, he can find no better conditions. Everything has become
    private property, and he must accept, or die of hunger. The result of this state
    of things is that all our production tends in a wrong direction. Enterprise takes

    together on terms of social and political equality. And inasmuch as they  cannot
    so live, while they do remain together there must be the position of superior
    and inferior, and I as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior
    position assigned to the white race. I say upon this occasion I do not perceive
    that because the white man is to have the superior position the negro should be
    denied everything. I do not understand that because I do not want a negro woman

    Before such an organization had begun to be considered possible and desirable
    by a whole class of thinkers, so as to be taken as the aim of a movement (which
    has now become one of the most important factors in modern social warfare), the
    word ‘anarchy’ was used universally in the sense of disorder and confusion, and
    it is still adopted in that sense by the ignorant and by adversaries interested

  t: There are two kinds of nationalism, revolutionary nationalism and reactionary  nationalism.
    Revolutionary nationalism is first dependent upon a people’s revolution with the
    end goal being the people in power. Therefore, to be a revolutionary nationalist
    you would by necessity have to be a socialist. It you are a reactionary nationalist
    you are not a socialist and your end goal is the oppression of the people. Cultural
    nationalism, or pork chop nationalism, as I sometimes call it, is basically a
    problem of having the wrong political perspective. It seems to be a reaction instead
    of responding to political oppression. The cultural nationalists are concerned
    with returning to the old African culture and thereby regaining their identity
    and freedom. In other words, they feel that the African culture will automatically
    bring political freedom. Many times cultural nationalists fall into line as reactionary
    nationalists. Papa Doc in Haiti is an excellent example of reactionary nationalism.
    He oppresses the people but he does promote the African culture. He’s against
    anything other than black, which on the surface seems very good, but for him it
    is only to mislead the people. He merely kicked out the racists and replaced them
    with himself as the oppressor. Many of the nationalists in this country seem to
    desire the same ends. The Black Panther Party, which is a revolutionary group
    of black people, realizes that we have to have an identity. We have to realize
    our black heritage in order to give us strength to move on and progress. But as
    far as returning to the old African culture, it’s unnecessary and it’s not advantageous
    in many respects. We believe that culture itself will not liberate us. We’re going
    to need some stronger stuff.

    Discrimination against the holder of one faith means retaliatory discrimination

    would be an abandonment of our real freedom of conscience and a reversion to the
    dreadful conditions of religious dissension which in so many lands have proved

  t: There is a strange duality in the human which makes for an ethical paradox. We
    have definitions of good qualities and of bad; not changing things, but generally
    considered good and bad throughout the ages and throughout the species. Of the
    good, we think always of wisdom, tolerance, kindliness, generosity, humility;
    and the qualities of cruelty, greed, self-interest, graspingness, and rapacity
    are universally considered undesirable. And yet in our structure of society, the
    so-called and considered good qualities are invariable concomitants of failure,
    while the bad ones are the cornerstones of success...Perhaps no other animal is
    so torn between alternatives. Man might be described fairly adequately, if simply,
    as a two-legged paradox.

    this unchallenged violence that allows a racist social system to perpetuate itself.
