quotes:
- a: Rudolf Rocker
  t: The urge for social justice can only develop properly and be effective when it
    grows out of man's sense of personal freedom and is based on that. In other words
    Socialism will be free or it will not be at all.
- a: Lucy Parsons
  t: Anarchists know that a long period of education must precede any great fundamental
    change in society, hence they do not believe in vote begging, nor political campaigns,
    but rather in the development of self-thinking individuals.
- a: Murray Bookchin
  t: There are no hierarchies in nature other than those imposed by hierarchical modes
    of human thought, but rather differences merely in function between and within
    living things.
- a: Federica Montseny
  t: The struggle is so great that the triumph over fascism alone is worth the sacrifice
    of our lives.
- a: Ursula K. Le Guin
  t: We live in capitalism. Its power seems inescapable. So did the divine right of
    kings. Any human power can be resisted and changed by human beings. Resistance
    and change often begin in art, and very often in our art, the art of words.
- a: Roderick Long
  t: Anarchists are committed to treating other people as equals, rather than as either
    masters or subordinates.
- a: Alan Moore
  t: Your pretty empire took so long to build, now, with a snap of history's fingers,
    down it goes.
- a: Ursula K. Le Guin
  t: You cannot buy the revolution. You cannot make the revolution. You can only be
    the revolution. It is in your spirit, or it is nowhere.
- a: Bhagat Singh
  t: Merciless criticism and independent thinking are two traits of revolutionary
    thinking. Lovers, lunatics and poets are made of the same stuff
- a: Max Stirner
  t: Never does a State aim to bring in the free activity of individuals, but always
    that which is bound to the purpose of the State.
